<h1> My Hobby</h1>
<section class="left"> In my free time I enjoy playing video games. One of the common video games that I play is called League of Legends. It is a game that involves strategy and skill while working with a team. There are five people to a team three lanes that occur on the map that is used to mainly play on. The players of a team can do things differently but the most common method is to assign certain roles to everyone. The roles are listed as follows: </section>
<section class="right">
  <ul>
  <li> Jungler</li>
  <li> ADC</li>
  <li> Top </li>
  <li> Mid</li>
  <li> Support</li>
  </ul>
