    <p> The image above is one of me dancing in a fountain after I lost a game of what are the odds with my friend, Jolene. One night we had been walking around downtown Rochester and came across this fountain. We played what are the odds and she had to dance in the fountain but I did as well. For my run, she decided to take a picture and video of me running around. The water was very cold that day as fall was setting in. </p>
